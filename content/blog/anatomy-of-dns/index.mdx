description: "One of the things that i have always been bad at is networking, and i during my _interneting_ i stumbled
upon a blog post taling about DNS. So i decided i would create a DNS client in Rust. SO might write a couple of post
about my adventures writing it. This first post will talk about the anatomy."

I like to just randomly spend my time on the internet, and every once in a while i stumble upon interesting blog posts.
I have for a very long time considered myself really bad at everything related to networking. So when i find good blog
posts about things im weak they get stuck in my head.

It was blog post about how you would go about to write a DNS client. I just glanced through it without looking at any
implementations, I then decided to look up the RFC and suddenly had this feeling that... i could write one of
those.

So in some blog posts i will write about all the things i learnt during the development and they will both be DNS
related, but also coding related, and how i solved ceratin problems.

## What is DNS (Domain Name System)?

Like i usually do, i start out with the wikipedia explanation.

<Blockquote source="wikipedia">
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers, services, and other
resources ... it translates readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and
identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.
